## Other SQL Clients

Heidi is only one out of many possible clients. We recommend it as a good place to start if you have never used SQL before, but there are also other options that are more suited to particular tasks. This list is a few that the Stats4SD has some experience with that might be of interest.

### Table Plus
(download here)[https://tableplus.io/windows]

This is a relatively new application - the Mac version was released in 2017 and the Windows version was released in Summer 2018.

The full version costs $49 for a perpetual licence. There is a free-forever version, and the only restriction I can find is that you can only have 2 tabs open at once, limiting the number of things you can do at once.

The company have a 'getting started guide', that provides instructions on performing some common tasks, such as creating a connection to a database, viewsing and editing data, running queries, and importing and exporting data from CSV files.

**positive**
- The interface is clear and clean. It's easy to see your tables, views and data. 
- The SQL code editor is very nice, with autocompletion for database and object names.
- The Free version has few limitations compared to the paid version. The main limitation is in the number of tabs you can have open at a time. (The free version is limited to 2 tabs).

**negative**
- As it's still new, it's missing some features that other SQL clients have.
- It has no visual query or relationship builder (but then, neither does Heidi).
- There is no easy way to visualise your data structures - you can view each table individually, but not all together.

**Editor's Note**
I personally use Table Plus for most of my SQL database work. I find its clean aesthetic is great for keeping all my databases organised (both local and ones on remote servers). It works for me because I also use the command line interface for doing more advanced workflows, like running database backups and moving databases between servers - so I don't miss the fact that these actions are hard or impossible within the software.

For anyone learning the basics of how databases work, I recommend sticking with Heidi, and possibly using DBForge to help you visualise the relationshipss in your structure, as those tools are more fully featured (and better supported!). But for people who are more comfortable with SQL, I recommend trying Table Plus to see if it works for you.

### DBForge
(download here)[https://www.devart.com/dbforge/mysql/studio/download.html] - Express is the free version of the software. Other versions offer a trial version, which expires after 30 days.

DBForge is made of a set of different tools for interacting with your databases. From the start screen, there are tabs that show you these tools. Two features make DBForge a very useful tool to explore - the Query Builder (under SQL Development tab) and the Database Diagram (under Database Design tab).

**positive**


The Query builder is useful for people new to the SQL language, as it allows you to build select queries, including complex features like joins, through a visual interface.

The Database design tool is s
