# Farmer Plot Trials

## Background

In this scenario we have recently conducted some trials with the farmers to see the effect of different treatments on maize to prevent infestation of striga.
We have worked with many of the farmers in previous years and hope to have additional data in our archives that provide household and plot information.

We now wish to analyse the results, considering our household and plot data also. We also want to create a system that will make it easy for us to do similar analysis in future years and with growing numbers of farmers.

## Aims of this example case

- Create a database that will store all our household, plot and trial data in a robust way
- Discover inconsistencies in the data that may have occured during collection and input, and clean appropriately
- Query the database to extract information you wish to use in your analysis
- Conduct an exploratory visual analysis to identify possible patterns and correlation in your data
