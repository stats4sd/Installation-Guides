# Cleaning the data

In this step we will using [OpenRefine](/tools/open-refine) to clean our trial data and repopulate our database.

If you do not have it installed you can follow the link to the tools page.

## 0. Backup the original _raw_ data

It is good practice to always retain a copy of original data in case you ever need to review or undo changes.
As such for each of our tables we will make a copy called _raw_, which we **will not ever make changes to**

## 1. Open OpenRefine

## 2. Create a new project for our trial data

## 3. Check each column for inconsistency

### a. Column name

### b. Column name

### c. Column name

## 4. Export your data to csv

## 5. Create a new table for the processed data

## 6. Import your data back into the database
