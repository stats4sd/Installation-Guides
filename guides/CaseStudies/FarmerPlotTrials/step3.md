# Defining relationships

In this step we will build links between the tables. This will enable us to extract information from both at the same time during querying, and will also help ensure we don't have missing data in our database in the future

## 1. Open DbForge

Whilst it is possible to do everything using Heidi, DbForge offers a nice visual tool to create and view relationships. Anything created here will exist as part of our database, and so still be available to Heidi

## 2. Create a new database diagram

## x. Load the tables

## x.

In the [next step](/case-study/farmer-plot-trials/step-4), we will do some data cleaning and create a set of 'processed' data tables that we can use for querying.
