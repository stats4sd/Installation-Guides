# Importing the raw data

In this step we will connect to our database directly from microsoft excel, and use it to import data into our database

## 1. Install the MySQL for Excel extension

Whilst it is possible to add csv data directly to a MySQL database, using excel provides the extra benefit of automatically detected the format of your data, defining correct column types in our table.

## 2. Open the raw data file

## 3. Connect to your database

## 3. Import the data into MySQL

### a. Trials data

### b. Household data

### c. Plot data

## 4. Confirm the data is in your database
