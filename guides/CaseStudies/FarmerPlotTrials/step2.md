# Importing the raw data

In this step we will connect to our database directly from microsoft excel, and use it to import data into our database

## 1. Install the MySQL for Excel extension

Whilst it is possible to add csv data directly to a MySQL database, using excel provides the extra benefit of automatically detected the format of your data, defining correct column types in our table.

The MySQL for Excel extension may have automatically have been installed when you installed MySQL. You can check by opening Excel and clicking on the **Data** tab

If it is not there you should open the [MySQL installer](/tools/mysql) and ensure the MySQL for Excel component installer is checked. If this still does not work you can directly download the MySQL for Excel installer <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/excel/" target="_blank">here</a>

## 2. Open the raw data file in excel

Download the following file and open in excel: <a href="/assets/resources/Farmer Trials Data.xlsx" download>Farmer Trials Data.xlsx</a>

## 3. Connect to your database

## 3. Import the data into MySQL

### a. Trials data
