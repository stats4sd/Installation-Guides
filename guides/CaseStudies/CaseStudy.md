# Case Study

This section aims to highlight examples of the different tools and concepts through a series of case studies. Each study provides opportunity to gain a practical understanding of the tools used, and deeper knowledge of underlying concepts.

The data for this case consists of a combination of household and plot information, alongside plot trials of different varieties of crops. We would like to analyse the data to search for links between different variables like soil type, intervention and yield, using a platform that will be easy to maintain and add more data to in the future.

In this study we go through the entire process of creating a database, defining sensible data structures, importing data, cleaning, querying and finally generating various charts and graphs.
