# Why Databases?

## What is a database?
_Simply: It is a system for storing data._

A database is a tool that can help you keep your data well organised, secure, and accessible by the right people. There are many different database systems, which have different strengths. 

## Why use one?
_Or, Why is a database better than a set of Excel Files?_

In a way, a set of Excel files is a sort of database - it's just a very inefficient one! You can store a lot of data in Excel files, but it quickly becomes hard to manage well, especially when you start getting data from multiple studies, across multiple years. It gets hard to ensure your data are consistently formatted and hard to see exactly what data you have.

Transitioning to a better database system can help you to: 

### 1. Organise your data
A good database makes it easier to keep your data well organised. With a bit of extra setup at the beginning, you can also keep all of your metadata within the same database, so you (and others) will better understand the meaning of your data when you return to it.

### 2. Structure your data
When you have data stored in lots of different files, it becomes hard to see how data in one file relates to data from another file.

For example, imaging you have a spreadsheet with information about the farmers in your network. In a different spreadsheet, you have data collected from a study conducted with some of those farmers. When you come to do an analysis, it can be tough to merge the data together when they're seperated like this.

Another example is when you have data from the same study, conducted over multiple years. If you keep each year's data in a different file, it can become hard to merge your data together for an analysis. It's very easy to have slightly different column headers, or to have your farmer_ids in different formats from each year. 

The benefit of a well structured database is that merging data in these ways becomes much easier.

### 3. Share your data
A database can actually make it easier to share your data. While you can share individual files through Dropbox or other tools, it quickly becomes hard to keep track of who has access to data - and which versions of the files they have. 

Any good database allows you to create user accounts, and assign permissions to those users, so you can keep track of who has access to what within your projects.

### 4. Use your data
Just as a database can help you share data with users, it can also help you use data in different ways. A lot of statistics packages and data visualisation tools can link to a database and allow you (or other people) to generate useful products from your data. 

## Summary
Moving from a set of Excel files to a database system definitely involves more work at the start. But if your data is more complex than a single, flat data table, it is definitely worth considering how a database can benefit your project.
