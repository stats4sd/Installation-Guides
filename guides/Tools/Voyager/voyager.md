# Voyager

# What is it?

Voyager is a data exploration tool to help create and disover visualisations for your data.

You can add your data from a csv file and then start to explore different visualisations,
specifying for example a variable for the x-axis and seeing different ways to represent the data. The available charts change depending on whether your data is numeric or category, and you can add additional information through use of colour, shape and facets.

# Why use it?

- It is quick to add data from a csv file
- You can create graphs which cannot be made easily in excel
- Suggested visualisations can help to identify patterns in the data that you might not have noticed
