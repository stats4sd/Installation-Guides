# Tools

Throughout the data flow cycle you will likely encounter numerous tools that can be used to support. At Stats4SD we have a few priorities when it comes to selecting the right tool for use in development projects. We believe that tools should be:

- Easy to use
- Free to use (ideally open source)
- Able to work offline
