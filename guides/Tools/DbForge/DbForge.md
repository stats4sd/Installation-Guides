# DbForge Express

# What is it? {#what}

A MySQL client for windows, developed by [Devart](https://devart.com). Devart have a large collection of SQL tools, most of which are paid-for applications. This guide focused on DbForge Express - the free version of thier MySQL client.

# Why use it? {#why}

It includes a set of useful tools to interact with your databases, including:
- A visual relationship builder, where you can add up to 3 tables to a diagram and then draw relationships between them.
- A visual query builder. You can drag in up to 3 tables to a diagram, view the relationships between them, and then build a query by selecting columns from the different tables. This can be useful to manually build queries involving joins without needing to write the SQL code yourself.

It also includes a more full-featured CSV file importer compared to Heidi's file importer. 

# How to Install {#install}

1. Download the installer from the Devart [download page](https://www.devart.com/dbforge/mysql/studio/download.html). Make sure to download the **Express** edition - the other versions are trials of paid-for versions that require buying a licence after 30 days. 

2. Run the .exe installer file. Follow the instructions on the dialog boxes.
 - On the FILE ASSOCIATIONS screen, uncheck the boxes, so .sql and .dbd files are not automatically associated with DbForge. 
 - On the STARTUP OPTIMISATION screen, keep the default option selected.
