# Introduction

Welcome to the Stats4SD Data Flow Toolkit. On this site you can find a growing number of practical tutorials and guides to concepts and tools related to data flow.

The site is aimed towards people working within global development contexts, with a particular focus on working with small-holder farmers. Many of the ideas can of course be generalised to other contexts, and the tools presented are many of the most popular throughout development and commercial applications to varying degrees and scales.

## Sections

Why use databases? How can you organise data in robust structures to allow efficient data flow, and make available in secure, ethical ways for use in generating outputs? In this section we aim to address some of these questions and many of the core concepts around data flow.

### <a href="{{ '/tools' | relative_url }}">Tools</a>

![image](/assets/images/tools.svg){:class="section-image"}
What tools can we use to help managing data, and how exactly to we get started using them? In this section We examine take a practical examination of 8 different software platforms that can be used to support data flow. All of the tools used are completely free for the use cases identified.

### <a href="{{ '/case-study/farmer-plot-trials' | relative_url }}">Case Study</a>

![image](/assets/images/case-study.svg){:class="section-image"}
How might all of this be used in a practical context? In this section we take a case study of workign with data collected from farmer plot trials to effectively clean, store, process and use to generate outputs to help feed back information to the farmers and other key stakeholders.
